      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This project was developed within the framework of the KE4H (Knowledge Engineering for the Humanities) course at the University of Bologna. 
        Our goal was to explore how the combination of SPARQL queries and Large Language Models (LLMs) can enrich an existing cultural heritage knowledge graph with new, meaningful content.
      </p>
      <p>
        We chose to focus on the <strong>Abbazia di Nonantola</strong>, a monumental Benedictine abbey in the province of Modena, which holds remarkable historical, religious, and artistic value. 
        Despite its relevance, it is still underrepresented in structured knowledge graphs, which makes it a perfect candidate for enrichment through semantic technologies and AI-powered language models.
      </p>
      <p>
        As our base knowledge graph, we selected <a href="http://wit.istc.cnr.it/arco/" target="_blank">ArCo</a> – the official ontology network and RDF dataset of the Italian Ministry of Culture. 
        ArCo offers a rich and well-structured representation of Italy’s cultural heritage and provides an excellent SPARQL endpoint for advanced semantic exploration. 
        Its modular architecture and domain-specific ontologies made it a strong choice for our project’s objectives, especially in the context of tangible heritage.
