![Conclusion](assets/images/conclusion.png)

Our project on the **[Abbazia di Nonantola](https://w3id.org/arco/resource/HistoricOrArtisticProperty/0100210793)** allowed us to explore the potential and limitations of semantic web technologies and large language models in the context of Italian cultural heritage. Here are the main takeaways:

---

### 🧠 SPARQL and ArCo Ontology

SPARQL and the [ArCo](http://wit.istc.cnr.it/arco/?lang=en) ontology proved to be powerful tools for accessing structured data related to Italy's vast cultural heritage. We learned how:
- **Keyword selection** is crucial to obtaining relevant and non-redundant results.
- SPARQL’s logic-based structure allows for very precise queries that can uncover both explicit and implicit knowledge gaps in the data.

### 🤖 Large Language Models

Our work with LLMs, particularly **[ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/)** and **[Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app)**, revealed the strengths and weaknesses of both systems:
- **Prompting techniques** that use examples, structured input, and clear task definitions (especially **few-shot** and **chain-of-thought**) lead to better and more accurate outputs.
- **[ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/)** often appeared more fluent and logically structured, especially in **chain-of-thought** tasks.
- However, **[Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app)** sometimes outperformed [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) in **few-shot** scenarios, offering more complete or contextually accurate results.

This finding contradicted our initial expectations and showed the importance of **model-specific prompting** strategies.

### 🌍 Future Developments

This project opens the door to several possibilities for future enrichment:
- **New RDF triples** (especially regarding the abbey’s inscriptions) could be integrated into ArCo to enhance its current representation of **[Abbazia di Nonantola](https://w3id.org/arco/resource/HistoricOrArtisticProperty/0100210793)**.
- A more **complete and unified IRI** for the abbey as a **"Historic Cultural Property"** could be introduced to improve data linkage.
- Further research could involve **cross-linking [ArCo](http://wit.istc.cnr.it/arco/?lang=en) with other ontologies** or **incorporating 3D depictions and architectural elements** to provide a richer and more immersive digital heritage experience.

Through this project, we gained hands-on experience in **semantic enrichment**, **data querying**, and **LLM prompting**, while contributing to the visibility of a lesser-known yet historically significant cultural site.
